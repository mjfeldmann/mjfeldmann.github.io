Hello dear reader,

Are you even out there?

This blog post is larter than the other ones have been. But I do have an excuse. I have been relentlessly working on a manuscript and finally submitted it on 04/07/2020 (!!). That article will doubtlessly make an appearance here at some point as I start to move away from image analysis stuff... maybe...

However, there is still much to cover. Today, I am going to let my fingers do the talking and comment on Berry et al "An automated, high-throughput method for standardizing image color profiles to improve image-based plant phenotyping." PeerJ. 2018. (10.7717/peerj.5727). This paper is pretty nice and touches on a lot of problems relared to color calibration. 

Color is so much more challenging that geometry. Last blog, I discussed CASS which can be used to calibrate the geometry in an image, given some prior thought. To date, I am not aware of a equivalent color-calibrate procedure.

There are two general procedures that are used to adjust the color in an image:

> (1) White, Gray, Black balancing (ColourQuant: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01652.pdf)

<ul style="center">
<center><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01652.pdf"><img src="/images/CQ.png" alt="ColourQuant" style="width:50%;height:50%;border:1px solid black"></a></center>
</ul>

> (2) Color checkers (10.3390/s120607063 )

<ul style="center">
<center><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435966/pdf/sensors-12-07063.pdf"><img src="/images/CCQ.png" alt="Color Checker" style="width:50%;height:50%;border:1px solid black"></a></center>
</ul>

For each of these, there are numerous specific procedures and I will not spend  time digesting and regurgitating their dark and dirty details to you now. Check out the reference list for Berry et al and you will get a glimpse at this.

Effectively, both rely on either a gray scale card typically with a black, gray, and white card with a known reflectance and then adjusting the image temperature and color profiles so that the whites are white and the blacks are black  and the grays are gray. The challenge is clear, if you have good black and bad whites and you adjust to get good whites, you will end up with blacks that aren't black. If you adjust for gray you may end with whites that are gray and blacks that are gray.


Best,
Mitchell
